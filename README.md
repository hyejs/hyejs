# 👋 Hi, I'm Jeonghye – a web developer who loves building with purpose!

I'm a web developer with 3 years of experience working on Java/Spring/Oracle-based web application.  
I enjoy creating reliable systems, improving performance, and turning real user needs into practical features.

Currently, I'm exploring **data engineering** and **computer vision (OpenCV)** to deepen my understanding of data-driven development and real-time user interaction.  
Both fields help me grow as a developer who builds smarter and more meaningful applications.

> “I'm not chasing perfection — I'm building step by step, with purpose and consistency.”
